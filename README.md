This is a Chat AI completely made by me. My plan is to make a completely virtual girlfriend. You can chat with her, but you have to keep her happy to get happy answers. It is some kind of a tamagotchi game.

FEATURES

You can chat with her. She can give different answers, even if the input is same. You can change which inputs she will recognise and which answers she will give in the state she is, in the TextFiles folder. The answer you want her to give to the input you entered, should be in the same line in answers texts. Also feeling values are like so. You can view the past chat in the viewport by dragging the mouse.

TO-DO's

I wanna implement a task system, where you take some tasks to get feeling points. Let's say you get a joy task, if you succeed, she will be happier, if you fail she will be horrible.

Whole chat viewport should be better.

There will be arts and animations for the girl.
